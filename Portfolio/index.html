            <p>My name is Kaden Garner, and I am committed to becoming a web developer. I enjoy coding, math, and art,
                which all contribute to my passion for building websites. I am proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript,
                HTML, CSS, SQL, and C#, and hold certifications in the first six. I also have a background in
                cybersecurity. I have completed advanced math courses such as Calculus BC and Linear Algebra, and will
                soon take Ordinary Differential Equations. While these courses are more common in software engineering,
                I believe this knowledge strengthens my skills as a web developer.</p>
